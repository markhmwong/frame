# Frame

Frame is an application to collate documentation of your home or investment property. The idea is Frame is a source of truth for the history of your property.

I decided to create this appplication as when I purchased my first property, there were a plethora of unknowns that was not apparent and having to rely on external sources (neighbours) for a bit of a history lesson. Things such as neighbours, the overall neighbourhood, and especially changes made to the property as time went by.

I felt there should be a metaphorical baton that should be transferred on to the next owner with all the details about that property but it ended up more like shredded information. For a property that i bought that is about 40 years old there appeared to be very little information about the place.

I bring Frame to life to expose the truths about the hard earned dollars you will be spending on your property so you can have a clearer transparency about how you will live out in your Principal Place of Residence.
